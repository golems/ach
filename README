OVERVIEW
========
Ach is an Inter-Process Communication (IPC) mechanism and library. It
is especially suited for communication in real-time systems that
sample data from physical processes. Ach eliminates the Head-of-Line
Blocking problem for applications that always require access to the
newest message. Ach is efficient, robust, and formally verified. It
has been tested and demonstrated on a variety of physical robotic
systems. Source code for Ach is available under an Open Source
BSD-style license.

INSTALLATION
============
    ./configure && make && make install

See the INSTALL file for details.

Alternatively, if you are using Debian or Ubuntu, you can use the golems.org APT repo.

1. Add the following to /etc/apt/sources:

    deb http://code.golems.org/debian squeeze golems.org

  (substitute the codename for your distribution in place of squeeze,
  e.g. wheezy, precise)

2. `sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install libach-dev ach-utils`

3. `sudo dpkg-reconfigure ach-utils`

LANGUAGE BINDINGS
=================
Language bindings are included for Common Lisp, Python, and Java.

* Common Lisp bindings use CFFI and can be loaded with ASDF.

* Python bindings are a C extension modules and a Python module 'ach'.
  This can be installed either via `make install` or via Python's
  distutils/pip.

* Java bindings use JNI.  See the class org.golems.ach.Channel.

See the INSTALL file for details.


FORMAL MODEL
============
Ach has been formally verified using the SPIN model checker.  This
formal model is included in the source distribution under the `./spin/`
directory.
