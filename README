OVERVIEW
========
Ach is an Inter-Process Communication (IPC) mechanism and library. It
is especially suited for communication in real-time systems that
sample data from physical processes. Ach eliminates the Head-of-Line
Blocking problem for applications that always require access to the
newest message. Ach is efficient, robust, and formally verified. It
has been tested and demonstrated on a variety of physical robotic
systems. Source code for Ach is available under an Open Source
BSD-style license.

INSTALLATION
============
    ./configure && make && make install

See the INSTALL file for details.

Alternatively, if you are using Debian or Ubuntu, you can use the golems.org APT repo.
